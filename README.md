# retrofit-logansquare

⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED. No further development is scheduled.

A `Converter` implementation using BlueLine Labs' [LoganSquare][logansquare] JSON serialization for Square's [Retrofit][retrofit] REST library.  
**Please note** that this library is solely intended for usage with **Retrofit 2.0.0 and above**! It won't work with 1.9 or earlier. Please refer [to this section of the README](#retro1) for instructions on how to include LoganSquare serialization on these versions.

## Download

Get it from Maven Central. Don't forget to include LoganSquare's dependencies as well. Check [their repo][logansquare] for the latest version:

```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation("de.mannodermaus.retrofit2:converter-logansquare:1.4.1")
}
```

## Usage

Plug in the `LoganSquareConverterFactory` like any other converter upon creating your `Retrofit` instance:

```java
Retrofit retrofit = new Retrofit.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://your.server.com/api/")
    .addConverterFactory(LoganSquareConverterFactory.create())
    .build();
```

## I'm using Retrofit 1.x, though!

In that case, it might be time to upgrade! If you can't or won't, refer to [this gist][v1gist] for a quick solution (no guarantees that it will work 100% of the time, though).
